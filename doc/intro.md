# Introduction to footballsquares

At our annual Super Bowl watch party we usually "bet" on the
outcome of the game using the "squares" concept. However, instead 
of "buying" individual squares we randomly distributed an equal number of
squares to each person interested in playing. Any left over squares end up being 
give to charity.

"Winnings" are distributed at the end of each quarter and at the end of the game
in equal amounts (20% each).

Over the years, we have written several programs to aid us playing this game,
the original (source code now lost) being a Java Swing application that just
created the board and allowed you to print a hard copy. This latest version allows
you to keep a record of scoring events, tells you who is currently winning and
projects who would become the winner on the next possible scoring event.
